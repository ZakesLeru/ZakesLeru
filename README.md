# About me 


**ZakesLeru/ZakesLeru** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on foundational cybersecurity skills training to later specialize in cloud malaware detection, incident response, and automated workstations management.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Azure cloud computing, Google Professional Cybersecurity program, Git/GitHub, Linux, SQL, Python, and SIEM  tools (wireshark and splunk).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Azure cloud computing foundemantals, securing Robotic Process Automations for Automated Workstations Management.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with practical steps to implement toward carving a niche in the cybersecurity field that intergates securing cloud computing and automated workstations.  
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the how and why the career change after years in theological studies.
